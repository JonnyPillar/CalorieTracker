CalorieTracker
==============

Disertation Project: Calorie Tracker

Spec:

Diet is an important aspect to life but more often than not food intake is not monitored by individuals and less often analysed of what has been consumed over a period of time. 
The aim is to determine nutrition intake statistics, store them over time in a database and analyse health trend using standard measures (Required Daily Allowance ï¿½RDA) and some calculations. 
The system will create a database of food types and simulate food intakes of an individual(s) over specific time periods and make predictions of their health trends. T
he system will be web-based and should produce individualised statistical analysis of their dietary intakes.
